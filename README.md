About the data:

This is the Ling-Spam corpus which contains four subdirectories, corresponding to four versions of the corpus.

1) bare
2) Lemm
3) Lemm-stop
4) Stop

Each one of these 4 directories contains 10 subdirectories (part1, ..., part10) which correspond to the 10 partitions of the corpus.
In the current project the 'bare' version is used only (9 subdirectories for training and 1 subdirectory for testing).
Each one of the 10 subdirectories contains both spam and legitimate messages, one message in each file. 
Files whose names have the form spmsg*.txt are spam messages. All other files are legitimate messages.
